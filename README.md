 Unpacking and analyzing the Fallout 4 save format binary file

## Usage
Copy "quicksave.fos" to a program directory and just run the program -- the decrypted screenshot from the gameplay save and all extracted data will be saved nearby.

## Examples

## Remarks
The application does not require the Fallout 4 game installed on your computer (the processes of decompressing and decoding binary fos-file data are low-level and operate directly on bytes).
